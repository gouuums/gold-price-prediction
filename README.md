# Time series forecasting of gold prices: statistical learning and econometric approaches

As part of a group project, the goal of this work is to try various type of models in order to time series forecasting of the gold price.
Using daily gold returns data from Yahoo finance, we explore various type of methods, from both econometrics and machine/deep learning to produce results. Main result is that the high volatility of daily (log-) returns leads to a poor prediction with classical econometric approaches, while statistical learning methods (mainly XGBoost and LSTM) lead to improvement. An hybrid approach combining a classical time series model and a machine learning model has shown its efficiency, particularly regarding at the obtained directionnal accuracy. 
Finaly, an application of the hybrid method is given, and a specific trading strategy is implemented with portfolio optimization.
